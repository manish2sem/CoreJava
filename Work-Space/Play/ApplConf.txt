application.conf [conf\]

This is the  file where basic information such as 
	database connection strings, 
	log levels, 
	modules to enable additional functionality, 
	supported application languages, or 
	the setting of the application mode 
is configured.


every configuration option follows the scheme:
# Some comment 
key = value 


adding and configuring modules in order to enhance the basic functionality of Play is part of the application.conf, and each module requires enabling it via defining its path:
module.foo=${play.path}/modules/foo.

NOTE:
 from play 1.2 modules are not configured via this mechanism, but via the new dependencies.yml file. You can still configure modules this way, but this is deprecated from then on.
 
 Another important setup is the log level of your application when using log4j-
 application.log=DEBUG
 
 
 application.conf file looks like a properties file, it really is not because of its UTF-8 encoding.
