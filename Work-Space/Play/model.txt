Any model you define should go into the models package[in the app/models 1directory].


public class User extends Model {
public String login;
@Required @Email
public String email;
}


The model[User] class inherits from Model. 
This is absolutely essential, because it allows you to use the so-called ActiveRecord pattern for querying of data.
all fields in the example code are public
