 Controllers
 
 Controllers represent the thin layer between HTTP and business logic. 
 They are called by the router. 
 requested resource is mapped to a controller method specified in the conf/routes file.
 
 
 public class Application extends Controller {
 
 	public static void showUser(String id) {
 		render();
	}
 
 }
 
 
 Java class work as controller is to have it extend from play.mvc.Controller. 
 All your actions[Methods] have to be static in order to be executed as controller methods.
 
 
 GET /user/{id} Application.showUser
 
 
 render() - This method is defined in the controller class and tells the controller to start the rendering phase. 
 A template is looked up and rendered. 
 As Play also follows the convention over configuration pattern, a default template location is assumed, which follows an easy naming
 
 
 
 controller layer should be as thin as possible. 
 This layer is not for business logic but merely for validation in order to ensure the model layer will only get valid data.
