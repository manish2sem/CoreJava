Using databases(Oracle) with Play

add driver-specific configuration in your configuration file.
	db.url=jdbc:oracle:thin:@db01.your.host:1521:tst-db01
	db.driver=oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver
	
Other ting can be done:
	
	reusing application server resources

to use datasources provided by the underlying application server. 
Put the following line in your config file:
	db=java:/comp/env/jdbc/myDatasource
	
configure your connection pool
	configure your connection pool


Using connection pools
a very important feature to ensure a performant and resource saving link to the database from your application. 
This means saving resources by not creating a new TCP connection every time you issue a query. 
Most JDBC drivers come with this out of the box, but you can also tweak the settings in your config file:
# db.pool.timeout=1000
# db.pool.maxSize=30
# db.pool.minSize=10


Configuring your JPA dialect
As Play uses hibernate, you need to specify a hibernate dialect:
	jpa.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.Oracle10gDialect
