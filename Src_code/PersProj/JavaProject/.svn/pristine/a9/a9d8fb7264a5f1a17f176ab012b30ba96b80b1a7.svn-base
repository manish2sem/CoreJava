/**
 * Information hiding is important for many reasons, 
 *	it decouples the modules that comprise a system, allowing them to be developed, tested, optimized, used, understood, and modified in isolation. 
 *		This speeds up system development because modules can be developed in parallel.
 *	It eases the burden of maintenance because modules can be understood more quickly and debugged with little fear of harming other modules. 
 * While information hiding does not, in and of itself, cause good performance, it enables effective performance tuning: 
 * once a system is complete and profiling has determined which modules are causing performance problems, 
 * those modules can be optimized without affecting the correctness of other modules. 
 * Information hiding increases software reuse because modules that aren’t tightly coupled often prove useful in other contexts besides the ones for which they were developed.
 * information hiding decreases the risk in building large systems, because individual modules may prove successful even if the system does not.
