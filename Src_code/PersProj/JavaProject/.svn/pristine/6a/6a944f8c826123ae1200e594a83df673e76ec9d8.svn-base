 * lambda expressions implements functionalIF and

 * 
 * Since there is only one abstract function in the functional interfaces, 
 * 	there is no confusion in applying the lambda expression to the method.
 * 
 * Compare the Lamda expressio with anonymous function:
 *   - Method body (business logic) remain same.
 *   - Lambda Expressions syntax is (argument) -> (body). 
 *   - body is for implemantation of abstract function defined in functional interface.
