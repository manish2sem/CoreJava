/**
 * 
 * A deque is a double-ended queue. You can insert items at either end and delete them  from either end.
 * The methods might be called insertLeft() and insertRight(), and removeLeft() and removeRight().
 * 
 * A deque provides a more versatile data structure than either a stack or a queue and 
 * is sometimes used in container class libraries to serve both purposes.
 * 
 * If you restrict yourself to insertLeft() and removeLeft() the deque acts like a stack. 
 * If you restrict yourself to insertLeft() and removeRight() (or the opposite pair), it acts like a queue.
