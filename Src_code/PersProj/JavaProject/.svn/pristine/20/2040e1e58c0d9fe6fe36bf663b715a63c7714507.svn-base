/**
 * Consider an array of integers wherein each element is +1 or -1 its preceding element.
 * Given a number, find the first occurence of this number (index) in this array without using linear search. 
 * 
 * For example, consider the array : 
 * 4 5 6 5 6 7 8 9 10 9 10 (each element in this array is +1 or -1 its preceding element) 
 * 
 * Input : 10 (find first occurence of 10 without using linear search) 
 * Output : 8
 * 
 * 
 * # Instantiate current pointer to first position in array - 4
 * # Calculate absolute difference between current value and expected value - 6
 * # If difference is 0, return current value, else, increment current pointer by the difference - a[6] = 8
 * # Repeat steps 2-4 until difference is not zero and current pointer is less than length of array
