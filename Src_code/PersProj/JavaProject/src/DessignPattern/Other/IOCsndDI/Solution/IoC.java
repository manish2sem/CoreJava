 * The basic principle of IOC : Do not call us we will call you.

 *  	- Main classes aggregating other classes should not depend on the direct implementation of the aggregated classes. 
 *  		Both the classes should depend on abstraction (either using interface or abstract class).
 *  	- Abstraction should not depend on details, details should depend on abstraction.
