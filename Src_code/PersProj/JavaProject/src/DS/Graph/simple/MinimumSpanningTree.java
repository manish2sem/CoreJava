/**
 * Minimum Spanning Tree : a graph with the minimum number of edges necessary to connect the vertices.
 *  In MST the number of edges E in a minimum spanning tree is always one less than the number of vertices V: 
 * 					E = V – 1
 * There are many possible minimum spanning trees for a given set of vertices.
 * We’re not trying to find a minimum physical length, just the minimum number of edges.
 * Length will come into the consideration when we talk about weighted graphs.
 * 
 * The algorithm for creating the MST is almost identical to that used for searching. 
 * It can be based on either the DFS or the BFS. 
 * The only difference between the MST and DFS, is that MST must somehow record the edges traveled.
