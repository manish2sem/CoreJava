/**
 * In an IdentityHashMap, two keys k1 and k2 are considered equal if and only if (k1==k2). 
 * (In normal Map implementations (like HashMap) two keys k1 and k2 are considered equal if and only if (k1==null ? k2==null : k1.equals(k2)).)
 * 
 * 
 *This class is not a general-purpose Map implementation! While this class implements the Map interface, it intentionally violates Map's general contract,
 *which mandates the use of the equals method when comparing objects.
 *This class is designed for use only in the rare cases wherein reference-equality semantics are required.
 *
 *A typical use of this class is topology-preserving object graph transformations, such as serialization or deep-copying.
 *To perform such a transformation, a program must maintain a "node table" that keeps track of all the object references that have already been processed. 
 *The node table must not equate distinct objects even if they happen to be equal. Another typical use of this class is to maintain proxy objects. 
 *For example, a debugging facility might wish to maintain a proxy object for each object in the program being debugged.

This class provides all of the optional map operations, and permits null values and the null key. This class makes no guarantees as to the order of the map; in particular, it does not guarantee that the order will remain constant over time.
