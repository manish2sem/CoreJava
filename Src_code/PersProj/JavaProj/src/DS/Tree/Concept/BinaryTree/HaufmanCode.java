/**
 * Haufman Code : an algorithm that uses a binary tree to compress data.
 * 
 * Each character in a normal uncompressed text file is represented in the computer by one byte (for the venerable ASCII code) or
 * by two bytes (for the newer Unicode, which is designed to work for all languages.).
 * In these schemes, every character requires the same number of bits. 
 * 		A 65 01000000
 * 		B 66 01000001
 * 
 * For text, the most common approach to compressing data is to reduce the number of bits that represent the most-used characters. 
 * In English, E is often the most common letter, so it seems reasonable to use as few bits as possible to encode it. 
 * On the other hand, Z is seldom used, so using a large number of bits is not so bad.
