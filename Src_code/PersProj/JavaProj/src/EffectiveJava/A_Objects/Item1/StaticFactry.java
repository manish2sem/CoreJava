/**
 * Advantage:
 * unlike constructors, they have names.
 * unlike constructors, they are not required to create a new object each time they’re invoked.
 * unlike constructors, they can return an object of any subtype of their return type.
 * they reduce the verbosity of creating parameterized type instances.
 * 
 * DisAdvantages:
 * classes without public or protected constructors cannot be subclassed.
 * they are not readily distinguishable from other static methods.
