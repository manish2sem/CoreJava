/**
 * The longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS): Problem Statement 
 * Find the length of the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that 
 * all elements of the subsequence are sorted in increasing order. 
 *  For example, length of LIS for { 10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80 } is 6 and 
 *  LIS is {10, 22, 33, 50, 60, 80}.
 *  Increasing Subsequence are - 9, 33, 50, 60, 80. This is not longest.
